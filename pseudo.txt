//main mod/ui
	-asks user input, calls the necessary functions <ok>
	-add employee <ok>
	-view departments 
		-view all employees in department
	-view all employees	

//database
	-stores employees through hashmap
	-vectors??

//back end (module of functions)
	-receives from user input and stores info in database
	-retrieves info from database and outputs.
	-retrieves info from database, sorts, and outputs.
	-contains functions which ui will execute

-utilising hashmaps in modules does not seem to be working!!
	>backend needs to bring in its own hashmap?
	>database fn needs to return a hashmap that backend can use?
	>will it be the same for root file?
-research about accessing contents of hashmap in module
>>>> something about global variables????
>>>> global variables issue seem to disappear when HashMap variables via
	let are just from via direct parent child module access.
	Creates errors when it goes past first degree parent child module
	access.

-add a feature that lets you take all keys associated to a value (department)
	and to output all its employees in alphabetical order.
	-iterate through all the keys, 
	compare the values of each keys
	according to the desired department(value), 
	add the necessary
	keys to a vector, 
	sort the vector, 
	printed the vector!

CONTINUE HERE!!!
-make the print_department function interactive!!
-now sort the department output!!
